    <p>The idea is to have a small element with absolute-sized backgrounds placed in different relative positions (e.g.,
      using percentages). The use of absolute and relative is essential here. Having absolute-sized backgrounds means
      that their size will not change depending on the size of the container, but their position is relative, so it will
      change (or give the impression of changing) when the container is resized.

      The relative distance between the dots is the same at all times. But as the container grows, the absolute distance
      between them expands too-similarly to how real fireworks work.</p>
